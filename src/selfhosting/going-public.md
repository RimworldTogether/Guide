# Making Your Server Public

To make your server publicly accessible, you have several options depending on your setup:

## Port Forwarding (Advanced)

Port forwarding enables external access to your server. Here's how to configure it:

1. **Get Your Private IP**:
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`.
   - **Linux**: Open Terminal and type `ip a` or `ifconfig`. Identify your network's IPv4 Address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).

2. **Access Router Settings**: Enter your default gateway IP into your browser to access your router's settings.

3. **Set Up Port Forwarding**: Navigate to the port forwarding section, typically found under "Advanced". Create a rule for TCP port 25555, assigning it to your IPv4 address, and save the configuration.

4. **Enable Device Communication**: In your router settings, ensure that devices on your network are allowed to communicate with each other. This is often found under settings like "LAN Isolation" or "Device Communication".

5. **Join the Server**: Use your public IP (discoverable via [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)) to connect. Ensure the server is operational and the setup is correct.

## VPN Tunneling (Windows Only)

Use a VPN to simplify server sharing without complex router configurations:

1. **Download and Install VPN**: We recommend using [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/).
2. **Launch VPN**: Start the VPN service and create a network with a unique name and strong password.
3. **Invite Friends**: Share the network details with your friends so they can join.
4. **Connect to the Server**: Use the VPN-generated IP to establish a connection.

## LAN (Local Area Network)

For local network connections without internet:

1. **Get Your Private IP**: Retrieve your private IP using `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ip a` (Linux).
2. **Configure the Server**: Input the private IP into your server's configuration.
3. **Enable Device Communication**: In your router settings, ensure that devices on your network are allowed to communicate with each other.
4. **Join the Server**: Connect using the private IP address. Ensure your firewall settings allow traffic on the server port.

# Docker Setup for RimWorld Together

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together.git
cd Rimworld-Together
```

## Update the Local Copy

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

## Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image for the RimWorld Together server:

```bash
docker build -t rimworld-together:latest .
```

## Run the Docker Container

Start the server with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/data:/Data" -p 25555:25555 rimworld-together:latest
```

## (Optional) Run in Detached Mode

If you want the container to run in the background:

```bash
docker run -d --rm -v "$(pwd)/data:/Data" -p 25555:25555 rimworld-together:latest
```

## (Optional) Using Docker Compose

For easier management, you can use Docker Compose. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  rimworld-together:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "25555:25555"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/Data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the service with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Accessing the Server Console

To access the running server console, use the following command:

```bash
docker attach <container_name>
```

You can find the container name using:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Linux Server Setup and Management Guide for RimWorld Together

### 1. Making Your Server Public

#### **Port Forwarding (Advanced)**

This process is essential for allowing external server access, particularly for those hosting on their own Linux machines:

1. **Get Your Private IP**: Open a terminal and type `ip a` or `ifconfig`. Locate the IPv4 address linked to your network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`).
2. **Access Router Settings**: Enter the default gateway shown in your command output into a browser to modify your routerâ€™s settings.
3. **Set Up Port Forwarding**: In the router settings under "Advanced Settings", establish a new rule for TCP port 25555 linked to your noted private IP address. Confirm the changes.
4. **Configure Firewall on Linux**: Depending on which firewall management tool your distribution uses, apply the corresponding command:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25555 -j ACCEPT  # iptables
   sudo ufw allow 25555/tcp                              # UFW
   sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=25555/tcp --permanent    # firewalld
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

5. **Join the Server**: Use your public IP to connect, ensuring everything is configured properly.

## Step 2: Automated Installation and Update Script

### 1. Create the Startup Script

- Create a file named `start_server.sh` with the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
folder_name="RimWorldServer"  # Adjust folder name as per your preference
system_type=$(uname -m)  # Auto-detect system architecture
use_screen=true  # Set to false if you do not want to use screen
auto_update=false  # Set to true if you want to enable automatic updates
force_old_start=false  # Set to true to skip update prompts and start the old version
version_file="version.txt"  # File to store the current version

# Load Configuration from file if provided
if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
    if [ -f "$1" ]; then
        echo "Using config file $1."
        . "$1"
        # Ensure all necessary variables are set
        for var in folder_name system_type use_screen auto_update force_old_start version_file; do
            if [ -z "${!var}" ]; then
                echo "Error: $var is not set in $1."
                exit 1
            fi
        done
    else
        echo "Error: $1 is not a file."
        exit 1
    fi
elif [ $# -gt 1 ]; then
    echo "Error: This script accepts a maximum of one argument (config file)."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Starting RimWorld Together server setup..."

    echo "Error: Could not fetch the latest version tag from GitHub."
    exit 1

else
    echo "New version $latest_tag available."
    if [ "$auto_update" = true ]; then
        update=true
    elif [ "$force_old_start" = true ]; then
        update=false
        echo "Manual update required. Continuing with the old version."
        sleep 5  # Pause to ensure the message is seen
    else
        sleep 5  # Pause to ensure the message is seen
        read -p "Automatic update is disabled. Do you want to update to the latest version? (yes/no): " update_choice
        case "$update_choice" in
            y|Y|yes|Yes) update=true ;;
            n|N|no|No) update=false ;;
            *) echo "Invalid choice. Exiting."; exit 1 ;;
        esac
    fi

    if [ "$update" = true ]; then
        echo "Updating GameServer to version $latest_tag..."

        mkdir -p "$folder_name"
        cd "$folder_name" || { echo "Error: Could not change to directory $folder_name"; exit 1; }

        echo "Downloading server files..."
        curl -L "https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together/releases/download/$latest_tag/linux-$system_type.zip" -o server.zip
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Error: Download failed."
            exit 1
        fi

        echo

 "Unzipping server files..."
        unzip -o server.zip && rm server.zip
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Error: Unzipping the server files failed."
            exit 1
        fi

        echo "$latest_tag" > "$version_file"
        echo "GameServer updated to version $latest_tag."
    else
        echo "Continuing with the current version."
        cd "$folder_name" || { echo "Error: Could not change to directory $folder_name"; exit 1; }
    fi
fi

# Start the server
if [ "$use_screen" = true ]; then
    echo "Starting the server in a detached screen session..."
    sleep 5  # Pause to ensure the message is seen
    if ! screen -dmS "RimWorldServer" bash -c './GameServer; exec bash'; then
        echo "Error: Failed to start the server in a screen session."
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "Server is running in a screen session named 'RimWorldServer'. You can attach to the session using 'screen -r RimWorldServer'."
else
    echo "Starting the server directly without screen."
    sleep 5  # Pause to ensure the message is seen
    set -m  # Enable job control (needed for fg 1)
    ./GameServer &
    server_pid=$!
    echo "Server is now running directly (PID: $server_pid)."
    fg 1  # Bring the GameServer process to the foreground so that input reaches the server.
fi
```

### Usage

- **To enable automatic updates**, set `auto_update` to `true`.
- **To force start the old version without prompting for an update**, set `force_old_start` to `true`.
- **To run the script** and check for updates or start the server, use the following commands:

  ```bash
  chmod +x start_server.sh
  ./start_server.sh
  ```

- **To use a config file**:
  - Copy the `#Configuration` section of the script into another file, and change the values to your liking.
  - Start the script with:

    ```bash
    ./start_server.sh FILENAME
    ```

  This allows you to manage multiple different directories/servers with one script file and multiple config files.

### Save the Script

- Save the script into a file named `start_server.sh` on your Linux server.

### Make the Script Executable

- Change the permissions of the script to make it executable by running:

  ```bash
  chmod +x start_server.sh
  ```

### Run the Script to Start Your Server

- Execute the script to start your RimWorld Together server:

  ```bash
  ./start_server.sh
  ```

This script will:

- Automatically detect the architecture of your system and adjust the download URL accordingly.
- Fetch the latest version of the server software from the RimWorld Together GitHub repository.
- Unzip the server files into a specified directory and clean up the downloaded zip file.
- Start the server inside a `screen` session, allowing the server to run in the background and be reattached at any time.

**NOTE:** Follow recommended patch note updates as this script does not automate them.

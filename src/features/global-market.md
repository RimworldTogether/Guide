# Global Market

The global market is a feature that allows players to trade with each other using a centralized trading system. Unlike other trading methods, this one doesn't require all involved players to be online simultaneously.

## How to Use

To engage in the global market, follow these steps:

1. **Build a Comms Console**: Construct a comms console inside any of your current settlements.
2. **Select Settlement**: Go to the world map and select the settlement where the comms console is installed.
3. **Open Global Market**: Press the `Global Market` button.
4. **Manage Trades**: Use the prompted menu to either add or remove items from the market.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- **Item Trading Only**: The global market can only be used to trade items, not pawns or any sentient beings.
- **Delivery Location**: Items bought from the global market will arrive at the selected settlement at the `Transfer spot` location. If there is no transfer spot, items will appear in the middle of the map.
- **Receiving Silver**: When selling items on the global market, the received silver will be delivered to the selected settlement at the `Transfer spot` location. If no transfer spot is available, the silver will be placed in the middle of the map.

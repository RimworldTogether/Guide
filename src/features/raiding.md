# Raiding

Traveling towards another player's settlement allows you to raid it in various ways.

## How to Use

1. **Form a Caravan**:
   - Move a `caravan` to the settlement of the player you want to raid.
   
2. **Choose Raid Type**:
   - **Online Raid**: If the target player is online, you can engage in an `online raid`.
   - **Offline Raid**: If the target player is offline, you can perform an `offline raid`.

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Offline Raids**:
   - Offline raids load a copy of the target player's last saved state. Actions in this mode do not affect the target player's actual game.

2. **Raid Cooldown**:
   - If enabled, there is a 1-hour cooldown before you can raid the same player again. This setting can be adjusted in the `ServerConfig.json` file inside the `Core` folder of the server.

## Raiding Features

1. **Initiate a Raid**:
   - Move a caravan to the settlement you want to raid and click the "Raid" button.

2. **Settlement Replica**:
   - Raiding generates a replica of the target player's settlement, including the base and any pawns present at the time of disconnection. Loot is based on a percentage of the target player's resources.

3. **AI Defense**:
   - During a raid, the settlement AI will focus on either the center of the map or a designated defense spot if one is present.

## Additional Features

1. **Defense Spots**:
   - Set up defense spots in the build menu. These spots designate areas where your pawns will defend your base and wander while offline.

2. **Chilling Spots**:
   - Designate areas for your pawns to relax during offline periods, useful for player visits.

3. **Transfer Drop Spots**:
   - Designate locations for goods to land during player trades.

4. **Hitching Spots**:
   - Create spots for hitching animals and forming caravans, helping to keep animals from wandering during encounters away from home.

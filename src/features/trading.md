# Trading

With this mod, players can trade with each other in various ways!

## Trading Overview

- **Transferable Items**: Almost everything in the game, including humans and animals, can be transferred. However, certain mod-specific items may cause issues or be untransferable due to their complexity. Use common sense and have fun!
- **Initiating Trades**: Create a caravan and travel to another player's settlement. Click the transfer button to open a trade window, where you can select items for gifting or trading. Both players must be online for gifting and trading.

### Types of Transfers

#### Direct Trading

1. Move a caravan to the settlement you want to trade with.
2. Press the transfer button to open the trading window.
3. Select the items you want to trade.
4. Choose "Trade" as the transfer mode.
5. Wait for the other player's counteroffer.
6. If accepted, the items will be transferred. The receiving playerâ€™s items will spawn in the caravan used for the trade, or at the transfer spot if designated.

#### Gifting

1. Move a caravan to the settlement you want to trade with.
2. Press the transfer button to open the trading window.
3. Select the items you want to gift.

#### Drop Pod Transfer

1. Prepare a drop pod setup in one of your settlements.
2. Place the items you want to transfer into the drop pod.
3. Select the target settlement and launch the pod as you would in vanilla gameplay.

### Additional Features

- **Transfer Drop Spots**: Designate spots on the map for received items to land. These spots are found in the build menu and ensure that your traded items spawn at a specific location.

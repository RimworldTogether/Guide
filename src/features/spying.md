# Spying

Traveling towards another player's settlement allows you to spy on it.

## How to Use

1. Move a caravan to the settlement of the player you want to spy on.
2. If the player is online, spying is not possible. If the player is offline, you can start spying by clicking the "Spy" button.

### To Keep in Mind

Spying loads a copy of the other player's last saved state, meaning that nothing you do while in this mode will affect their actual game.

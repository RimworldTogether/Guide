# Road Building

Players can construct and demolish various types of roads across the planet by paying a fee.

## Fees & Enabling

The server owner can set a silver fee for building roads and enable or disable road construction in the `RoadValues.json` file located in the `Core` folder.

* By default, all roads are free to build and enabled.

### Default Settings

```json
{
  "AllowDirtPath": true,
  "AllowDirtRoad": true,
